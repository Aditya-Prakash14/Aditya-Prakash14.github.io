### Version 2: Story-Driven

I discovered my passion for cybersecurity after successfully completing my first CTF challenge ‚Äî and I haven't stopped breaking (and securing) things since.

As a cybersecurity researcher and developer, I specialize in building tools that make security testing more accessible and effective. Whether it's a network fuzzer that automatically discovers vulnerabilities or a CTF platform that teaches practical security skills, I love creating pragmatic solutions to complex problems.

**My Journey:**
Started with basic scripting ‚Üí Built reconnaissance tools ‚Üí Discovered fuzzing ‚Üí Created learning platforms ‚Üí Now researching advanced vulnerability discovery techniques

**Current Focus:**
üîç Network protocol fuzzing and automated vulnerability research
üõ°Ô∏è Building RootCode ‚Äî a hands-on security learning platform
üì± Developing security-focused mobile and web applications
ü§ñ Exploring ML applications in security detection and assessment

**Achievements I'm Proud Of:**
‚úÖ eJPT Certified with practical pentesting experience
‚úÖ Top 3% on TryHackMe through 500+ security challenges
‚úÖ Founded Cybersecurity Club serving 100+ students
‚úÖ Published network_fuzzer.py ‚Äî used in security labs globally
‚úÖ Active bug bounty hunter with responsible disclosure experience

**Tech Philosophy:**
I believe the best security tools are those that:
‚Ä¢ Lower the barrier to entry for beginners
‚Ä¢ Automate repetitive tasks for professionals
‚Ä¢ Are open-source and community-driven
‚Ä¢ Teach while they test

**Beyond Code:**
When I'm not hunting for vulnerabilities, I'm:
‚Üí Creating CTF challenges for community competitions
‚Üí Writing technical writeups and case studies
‚Üí Mentoring students interested in cybersecurity
‚Üí Contributing to open-source security projects

**Looking For:**
Opportunities to collaborate on innovative security research, contribute to impactful projects, and grow alongside talented security professionals.

Let's build a more secure digital world together!
